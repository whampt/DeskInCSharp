This is a C# ASP.NET web form project written using Visual Studio 2017 as practice. The finished project will have a Home, Login, Register, 
Contact and About page accessible to anyone who visits the website.  The use case is an imaged small business that provides tech support for clients.
The members will be clients requesting tech support. The members section is accessible to those who register on the registration 
page and then login. The Login system uses ASP.NET Identity package and will have email verification & captcha at a later date. The login system 
will eventually have a fork where there is no Register page so that only invited clients can login.

The Members Section is currently under construction. Email will be integrated at as the project develops.The goal is to have tickets submittable 
via the Submit page. The tickets will be stored in a LocalDb when hosted on Azure(the intended host) and copies will be submitted to the webmaster's 
email and the submitters email.

CSS is also under construction. The author of this project is looking for someone with a better eye for design to assist with layout, 
color choices, graphics and other design considerations.  The layout is currently a rough version of the Holy Grail layout. The color choices are garish
by design for the moment but are not intended to stay that way. 

The Check page is for logged in users to check the status of their current and former tickets. Under construction.

The Pay page is for logged in users to check and pay their bill via PayPal. Under Construction.
